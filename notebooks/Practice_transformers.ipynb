    "## Natural Language Processing\n",
    "NLP is a machine learning field that understand the words in a sentence individually and the context behind using those words. Some of the common NLP tasks are - reviewing and classifying whole sentences, identifying each word as part of speech(noun, verb , adjective, entity), generating text with masked words, extracting information from the context, transalting or summarizing the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformers \n",
    "One of the mdoels used for solving NLP tasks is the transformers. I will be using the transformers library from Huggingface.\n",
    "The pipeline API function will connect the pre-trained model with pre-processed inputs and post-prpcessing predictions to directly output the sentiment label of the sentence with accuracy score. For example- Zero-shot classification pipeline allows in annotating the text and classify the sentence into sentimental labels. Text generation pipeline will auto-complete the sentence by generatinhg the remaining text with a provided prompt. Some of the other examples include - Named entity recognition, question answering, summarization, transalation\n",
