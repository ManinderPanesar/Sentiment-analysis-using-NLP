# Sentiment-analysis-using-NLP
## Overview

In this project, a recommender system based on sentiment analysis using tweets is proposed for the goal of providing recommendations to users for investment in cryptocurrencies. The question at hand: can influential leaders' tweets drive the cryptocurreny or market? 

## Background and Motivation

The cryptocurrency market has been turbulent since its inception, but the recent price fluctuations have been significantly volatile compared to traditional currencies, or even gold. In January 2021, the price of Bitcoin jumped from around $32,000 to $38,000 in a matter of hours, resulting in a $111 billion rise in market value. This rise occurred as a result of the following event: Elon Musk, the founder of firms such as Tesla and SpaceX, changed his Twitter profile bio to just include the term "#bitcoin" in his account description[1].

## Goals

The goal of this project is to integrate recommendation system approaches with sentiment analysis to create the most accurate recommendations for users.
