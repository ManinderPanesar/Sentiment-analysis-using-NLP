# Sentiment-analysis-using-NLP
## Overview

In this project, a recommender system based on sentiment analysis using tweets is proposed for the goal of providing recommendations to users for investment in cryptocurrencies. The question at hand: can influential leaders' tweets drive the cryptocurreny or market? 

## Background and Motivation

The cryptocurrency market has been turbulent since its inception, but the recent price fluctuations have been significantly volatile compared to traditional currencies, or even gold. In January 2021, the price of Bitcoin jumped from around $32,000 to $38,000 in a matter of hours, resulting in a $111 billion rise in market value. This rise occurred as a result of the following event: Elon Musk, the founder of firms such as Tesla and SpaceX, changed his Twitter profile bio to just include the term "#bitcoin" in his account description[1].

In this research, we are using natural language processing to build Twitter sentiment driven trading indicators. We will investigate if there is a correlation between cyptocurrency-related tweets and their price movements and how these sentiment driven indicators can be used to create trading strategies for the users. 

## Goals

The goal of this project is to integrate recommendation system approaches with sentiment analysis to provide the most accurate recommendation strategies for users. This can be achieved through a number of phases: 
Phase 1 will be focused on developing the sentiment analysis classifer.  For the intital set up, the classifier will extract tweets containing hashtags of 1 particular cryptocurrency, e.g. Dogecoin. As we move into the next phases, the classifier will be modified to include and analyzed tweets of other cryptocurrencies. This classifier will extract the data from Twitter, analyzed the data to determine the correlation between the tweets and the fluctuation in the cyrtocurrencies prices, and classify sentiments in positive, negative or neutral categories depending on these analysis.
In the phase 2, a recommendation engine is designed based on the twitter sentiment analysis classifier. 
Phase 3 will be extended to build a machine learning model that will combines the sentiment classifier and the recommendation system in order to develop sentiment driven trading indicator application. 

## Datasets

## Practical Applications
This combined machine learning model to develop trading strategies for the users based on sentiment analysis and recommendation system could be useful for crytocurrency exchange platforms such as coinbase or wealthsimple. 

## Milestones
Phase 1 - Sentiment analysis classifier
Phase 2 - Recommendation system 
Phase 3 - Combined machine learning model
